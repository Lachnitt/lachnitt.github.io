Welcome to my website! I am Hanna a fourth-year PhD student at Stanford University. I am adviced by [Clark Barrett](https://theory.stanford.edu/~barrett/) and part of the [CENTAUR lab](https://centaur.stanford.edu/).

I am interested in Automated Reasoning and Formal Verification. Currently, I am working on reconstructing fine-grained proof certificates from the cvc5 SMT solver in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle.

News:

- Coming soon! Our tool paper on IsaRARE has been accepted to TACAS 24. IsaRARE is a tool that can transform rewrite rules written in the RARE language into Isabelle lemmas.
